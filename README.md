# Hangman_game
Python files for Hangman game (french)
I developed this code as part of a dojo activity at Wild Code School. In a group of 4 people, we had around 1 hour to develop a Hangman game (in French). We didn't finish the task in time, so I decided to finish the development of the code on my own.
hangman_drawings.py, hangman_functions.py and list_of_words were all provided by the school as part of the assignment. The code included in hangman_code.py has been developed by my group and myself, but what we developed as a group didn't work yet at the end of the assignment.
